compile and run the code as follows:

$ make -f makefile all
$ ./mutator 0.5
$ ./mutator 0.9
$ ./mutator 0.99

to clean and leave just the source code

$ make -f makefile clean

to test the Mark & Sweep Algorithm, go to the 
makefile and in CFLAGS add a -DMS, 
to test the Mark & Compact Algorithm add a -DMC,
for the Copy Collection algorithm a -CC flag works, but I 
haven't implemented the algorithm.
